# select on a form builder
<%= f.select(:city_id, ...) %>

If you are using select (or similar helpers such as collection_select, select_tag) to set a belongs_to association you must pass the name of the foreign key (in the example above city_id), not the name of association itself. If you specify city instead of city_id Active Record will raise an error along the lines of ActiveRecord::AssociationTypeMismatch: City(#17815740) expected, got String(#1138750) when you pass the params hash to Person.new or update_attributes. Another way of looking at this is that form helpers only edit attributes. You should also be aware of the potential security ramifications of allowing users to edit foreign keys directly. You may wish to consider the use of attr_protected and attr_accessible. For further details on this, see the Ruby On Rails Security Guide.
